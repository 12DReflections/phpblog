		What if we stepped away for just a moment from any concept already mapped out and 
		deeply vetted by the great philosophers of all time and reflected a bit on this question from a 
		more internal focus for a moment?  I feel (not think) that our essence and being are one and the 
		same.  I think and feel that what we try to get at with our methods of inquiry, namely the use of language 
		and thought with language without feeling, makes it very difficult to define the indefinable.  Take the hard 
		and easy questions of consciousness for example.  There are so many perspectives and each uniquely 
		holding merit from their own origins.  We are essence or you can even call it consciousness in form or at 
		least seeming to be given our current framework (all that we were taught about our existence from day 
		one of a physical existence perspective).  But let me ask you a question.  Have you ever sat quietly for a 
		moment and felt your own essence, the essence of a flower, the essence of the entirety of the universe as 
		it is simply be-ing?  With limited language we can come up with all manner of very intelligent hypotheses 
		and theories and some may be right and some may be wrong.  None of that really matters, I feel.  
		At the end of the day, the only opinion worthy of any merit truly is your own.

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Ontological Formations</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">December 23, 2013 by <a href="#">Jacob</a></p>

            <p>The concept of 'ontological formations' refers to formations of social relations understood as 
	    dominant ways of living. Temporal, spatial, corporeal, epistemological and performative relations are 
	    taken to be central to understanding a dominant formation. That is, a particular ontological formation 
	    is based on how ontological categories of time, space, embodiment, knowing and performing are livedâ€”objectively 
	    and subjectively. Different ontological formations include the customary (including the tribal), the traditional,
	    the modern and the postmodern. The concept was first introduced by Paul James' Globalism, Nationalism
	     Tribalism together with a series of writers including Damian Grenfell and Manfred Steger.
